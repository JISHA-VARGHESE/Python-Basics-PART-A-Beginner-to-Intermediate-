Mini Project: Student Database
A simple real-life project where I:
Stored details of multiple students using lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
Added new students dynamically
Printed student details (name, age, subjects)
Extracted all unique subjects across students
Retrieved specific student details (e.g., Sara’s agWrite a replyReturn to codeCode has comments. Press enter to view.
